        text="After getting my start as a programmer in neuroscience labs at Tufts and UT Austin, I took on a series of open-ended projects at Wayfair in which I had generous control of project direction and design. I've had experience building web/mobile apps, machine learning models, a streaming data pipeline, and more. The part of the process of software development I most enjoy is fine-tuning the results of an application through creative experimentation."
